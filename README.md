# CS-350-Emerging-System-Arch-and-Tech
### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.  
The main project in this course was to help a company named SysTec develop a smart thermostat prototype using a TI board (CC3220 LaunchPad). The thermostat would use a TMP006 temperature sensor to read room temperature via I2C, indicate whether heating was on or off with an LED via GPIO, two buttons to increase and decrease the set temperature via UART, and also use the UART to simulate data being sent to the server (The goal of the final thermostat would be to send data to SysTec's server over WiFi).  

  The problem being solved was that the company wanted to get into the smart thermostat market ASAP since it is forecast to reach nearly $9 billion by 2026.
