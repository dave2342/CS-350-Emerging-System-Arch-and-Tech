# CS-350-Emerging-System-Arch-and-Tech
### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.  
The main project in this course was to help a company named SysTec develop a smart thermostat prototype using a TI board (CC3220 LaunchPad). The thermostat would use a TMP006 temperature sensor to read room temperature via I2C, indicate whether heating was on or off with an LED via GPIO, two buttons to increase and decrease the set temperature via UART, and also use the UART to simulate data being sent to the server (The goal of the final thermostat would be to send data to SysTec's server over WiFi).  

  The problem being solved was that the company wanted to get into the smart thermostat market ASAP since it is forecast to reach nearly $9 billion by 2026.  

### What did you do particularly well?  
I think most of the project was done relatively well. I enjoyed developing the code that checks and compares the set point temperature and the current temperature to change the heating element and turn an LED on or off was my strongest/best area.  

### Where could you improve?  
Improving is always an option. Organization of the code is often my weaker point, and using the default files and code snippets from the course to include into our own program code was a bit tricky to organize. Each function we had to copy into our own code included separate variables, so I tried my best to organize it all together and keep variables together. I do need to work on this, as well as timing of completion of the project. It took nearly two weeks, so I should further my skills in code development.  

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?  
I'm always using Google, the Shapiro library, etc. for my network. I think, and many people have suggested it, that using the tutoring/help section of SNHU's website should be added, as many students may be more advanced in coding than myself, so I'm sure I could learn a great deal of knowledge there.  

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?  
We learned MANY skills during thi scourse and throughout the project. Using a task scheduler, state machine, etc. have been very useful, and I believe these would help my future course work and possibly even work once I get a career in this field.  


### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  
This project was very difficult, but I tried my best to organize the code and comment most of the added lines of code so that someone reading it would understand what each line or block of code is doing, and why.
